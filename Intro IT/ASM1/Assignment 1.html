          <p>Many people often think that people who study information technology will be very dry and not have many emotions.

I can play a lot of sports but I'm not really good at any particular one.</p>

        <p>       In the current industrial revolution 4.0, the computer industry is growing dramatically day by day. Information technology has brought many practical applications because of new and unique technology ideas. Besides, the steady development of information technology has opened up many job opportunities for computer engineers. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft Corporation, has been one of my admirable people from an early age because of the historical research that included the appearance of the first Microsoft operating system around the world. The first time I was exposed to programming was when I was in 8th grade, when it was considered a formal subject in the curriculum and I was very interested in this subject. My passion for IT grew even more prominent when I won second prize in the best student class in Pascal programming, which is my first experience in high school. These are the reasons that information technology has made me interested and researched on this topic.
</p>
        <br>
        <P>RMIT University is known as one of the world's leading and dynamic universities. RMIT provides students with a comfortable learning environment with a practical learning path instead of a boring theory, enabling them to develop the necessary skills in industrialization and modernization. That is one of the reasons I choose RMIT University for my student life. Studying here, students can unleash their creativity, improve the quality of their homework with modern facilities. With valuable academic qualifications and a university degree, RMIT opens up a great career opportunity for students at this school.</P>
        <br>
        <p>I decided to choose information technology to pursue my interests and to practice soft skills including teamwork. Besides, the knowledge of lecturers is the foundation for being able to succeed in life in general and in information technology in particular. I hope to learn more programming languages and have more knowledge about security and information systems after completing this course. Moreover, I want to become a security expert to solve the problems of safety when using social networks today.</p>

                <br>
                <p>According to the results of Myers-Briggs, learning style and Big Five Personality test , I belong to a Turbulent Entrepreneur personality. I have been motivated by logical issues, often choosing careers related to mechanical skills, sports or external negotiation. Theory and abstract thinking are not often my good choices when learning at school. I also want to be able to flexibly handle issues without having to follow an existing rule. However, the energy and passion are virtually unlimited when it comes to areas they consider to be practical and exciting.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>I have an Auditory learning style which is very sensitive, easily distracted by sound simply because they like to listen and communicate. People in this learning style who are natural diplomats and have a learning style of hearing and speaking to learn, but they may have trouble reading silently or staying involved in a completely quiet classroom. Having a very good memory and remembering everyone's name only after meeting, they like to participate in debates and presentations, know how to adjust the volume and voice to suit each different context or situation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The Big Five Personality test has measured that I have the highest percentage of agreeableness which is easy to forgive and sympathize with people around me.
I often tend to care about the thoughts and receive the happiness when serving other people before I care about myself. The above indicators also show that I often experience negative emotions, worry when doing something wrong and always feel frustrated about myself. But, my characters are fairly evenly composed maintaining openness, conscientiousness, extraversion.
</p>
                <br>
                <p>In my opinion, my personality is able to harmonize with the team easily because of the auditory learning style. I have the ability to listen and contribute ideas for my teammate perfectly. Moreover, a strong source of energy in me will be a great motivation to motivate the members of the group to improve our ability to work and improve the quality of our productivities. With good communication skills, I will play a connection role with our members together. Having me in your team will be a good idea to become the best group ever.</p>
